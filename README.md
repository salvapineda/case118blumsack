# IEEE 118-Bus System (Blumsack Modified Version)

This repository contains the modified IEEE 118-bus system as proposed by Seth Blumsack in his PhD thesis:

> **Blumsack, S. (2006).** *Network Topologies and Transmission Investment Under Electric-Industry Restructuring*. Carnegie Mellon University.

## Description

The IEEE 118-bus system is a widely used test case for power system studies. Blumsack's modifications introduce changes in the network topology, making it useful for analyzing transmission investment and restructuring effects. This repository provides:

- A `.m` file compatible with **MATPOWER**.
- A `.mat` file for easy loading into **MATLAB**.

## Files

- `case118_blumsack.m` – MATPOWER-formatted case file.
- `case118_blumsack.mat` – MATLAB workspace file containing the same case.
